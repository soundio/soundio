/**
Sink

```
const sink = stage.createNode('sink');
```

You can't automate params until their nodes have a route to
context.destination. That's just the way things work. A sink
allows you to attach to destination without outputting any
sound. There is one sink node per context â€“ all 'instances'
of sink in all graphs for a context are actually the same
instance.
